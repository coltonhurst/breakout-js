# breakout-js
Breakout game in pure JS. Followed the Gamedev Canvas tutorial.

The tutorial can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).

I've currently finished the tutorial. I was originally planning on refactoring the code and adding some new features to the game, but that's tabled for now.

This was a good project to learn the basics of the HTML canvas and how it can be used for game development. I can easily see how powerful HTML5 games can be easily written thanks to the new canvas.

See the final result on my website [here](https://www.coltonhurst.com/projects/breakout-js).
