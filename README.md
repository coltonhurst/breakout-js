# breakout-js
Breakout game in pure JS. Followed the Gamedev Canvas tutorial.

The tutorial can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).

Currently, I'm following the tutorial! Though I really want to refactor the code and make things concise and pretty, I'll wait until I finish all 10 steps. Then I can go back and make some modifications :)
